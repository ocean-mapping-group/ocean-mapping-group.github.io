# readAngStrip

## Description
`readAngStrip` is an interactive command-line utility for reading and displaying the contents of a single Angular Response (AR) file, which contains binary `JEM_Angular_Response` structures. It allows the user to interactively select and view individual stacked angular response records (referred to as "stacks") within the file. The tool provides a detailed listing of the parameters within the selected AR record, including geographical coordinates, time information, and various backscatter and sigma values.

## Usage
```bash
readAngStrip [OPTIONS] <AR_file>
```
The program is interactive and will prompt the user for the stack number to view.

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `-v` | Enable verbose output. | |
| `<AR_file>` | **Required.** The input Angular Response (AR) file (e.g., generated by `compAngStrip` with `-attrib`). | `survey_0123_Ang_Attrib_500` |

## Interactive Prompts
The tool will prompt the user to:
*   `input stack no to use---(max <max_stacks>) (0 to exit)`: Enter the desired stack number to view its details, or `0` to exit the program.
