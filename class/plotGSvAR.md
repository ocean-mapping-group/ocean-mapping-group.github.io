# plotGSvAR

## Description
`plotGSvAR` is an interactive command-line utility designed for plotting relationships between various geological sample (GS) parameters and Angular Response (AR) parameters derived from multibeam sonar data. It assumes that `findCloseAR` has already been run to establish indices between AR files and GS sample locations. Users interactively select which parameters to plot (GS vs AR, GS vs GS, AR vs AR, or all available parameters). It can optionally apply a beam pattern (BP) curve to the AR data.

## Usage
```bash
plotGSvAR -samples <sample_file> -index <index_file> -arnames <ar_list_file> [OPTIONS]
```
The program is interactive and will prompt the user for choices after initial setup.

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `-v` | Enable verbose output. | |
| `-bp <bp_file>` | Specifies a beam pattern (BP) file to load and apply as a residual response curve to the Angular Response data. | `my_beam_pattern.bp` |
| `-samples <sample_file>` | **Required.** An ASCII file containing geological sample data (latitude, longitude, and various sediment parameters). This is the same file used by `findCloseAR`. | `geological_samples.txt` |
| `-index <index_file>` | **Required.** An ASCII file generated by `findCloseAR` that maps geological sample sites to nearby Angular Response records. | `GS_proximities` |
| `-arnames <ar_list_file>` | **Required.** An ASCII file listing the paths to all Angular Response (AR) files. This is the same file used by `findCloseAR`. | `list_of_AR_files.txt` |
| `-outfile <name>` | Specifies an output file to dump the chosen AR and GS parameters. (Note: The source code indicates this is "not implemented" as a command-line option for direct output but is mentioned in the USAGE string.) | `mean_gs_v_BS45` |

## Interactive Prompts
The tool will interactively prompt the user for the following choices:
*   **Plot Type:** Choose between GS vs AR plots, GS vs GS plots, AR vs AR plots, or outputting ALL GS AND AR parameters.
*   **GS Parameters:** If plotting GS parameters, a menu of 16 different geological sample parameters (e.g., mean grain size, standard deviation, percent gravel) will be presented for selection.
*   **AR Parameters:** If plotting AR parameters, a menu of 10 different Angular Response parameters (e.g., average BSo, average BSn, parameters related to boundary locations and strengths) will be presented for selection.
*   **AR Side:** When selecting AR parameters, the user will be asked to choose which side of the sonar swath (Port only, Starboard only, or Either side) to use.
*   **Grazing Angle Range:** If choosing average BS or CV over a specific grazing angle range, the user will be prompted to enter high and low grazing angles (where 90 is NADIR and 0 is FAR-RANGE).
