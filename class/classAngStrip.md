# classAngStrip

## Description
`classAngStrip` is a command-line utility designed to process multiple Angular Response (AR) files (likely generated by other OMG-HDCS tools from multibeam sonar data). It calculates various parameters for each AR record, including statistics for along-track variations (e.g., standard deviation of pixel changes across boundaries). It can apply a predefined Beam Pattern (BP) curve to the angular response, find inflexion points in the curve (related to beam pattern characteristics), and then characterize the Backscatter (BS) curve by fitting coefficients. The processed information is then written back to the input AR file or a new output file.

## Usage
```bash
classAngStrip [OPTIONS] <input_AR_file(s)>
```

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `-v` | Enable verbose output. | |
| `-out <output_file>` | Specifies an output file to write the processed AR records. If not specified, changes are written back to the input file(s). | `processed.AR` |
| `-bp <bp_file>` | Specifies a beam pattern (BP) file to load and apply as a residual response curve to the angular response data. | `my_beam_pattern.bp` |
| `<input_AR_file(s)>` | **Required.** One or more input Angular Response (AR) files to be processed. | `raw_data_01.AR raw_data_02.AR` |
