# defineWatershed

## Description
`defineWatershed` is a command-line utility that delineates a watershed or catchment area from a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Given a starting "pour point" coordinate, it iteratively finds all pixels that are hydrologically uphill and contribute to that point. The output is an 8-bit mask file identifying the watershed area.

The tool can operate in two modes:
1.  **Simple Uphill Search:** It identifies any adjacent pixel that is higher in elevation than a pixel already in the watershed.
2.  **Downslope-Constrained Search:** By using a pre-computed `.downSlope` file (from `defineDownSlope`), it performs a more hydrologically accurate analysis, ensuring that a candidate pixel not only is uphill but also naturally drains towards a pixel already in the watershed.

## Usage
```bash
defineWatershed -startcoord <x> <y> [OPTIONS] <floatfile> [8bitfile]
```

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `-startcoord <x> <y>` | **Required.** The starting X and Y pixel coordinates of the watershed outlet or "pour point". | `-startcoord 300 400` |
| `<floatfile>` | **Required.** The input JHC-format 32-bit floating-point (`.r4`) DTM file. If a full name with extension isn't given, `.r4` is assumed. | `my_dtm.r4` |
| `[8bitfile]` | **Optional.** The output 8-bit mask file. If not specified, a name will be auto-generated by appending `.wsh` to the input float file's prefix. The tool can also read and add to a pre-existing mask file. | `my_watershed.wsh` |
| `-use_downSlope` | A flag that enables the more rigorous, hydrologically-constrained search. When used, the tool expects to find a corresponding `<floatfile>.downSlope` file. | |
| `-downhill_tolerance_m_per_pixel <value>` | A floating-point value that relaxes the "uphill" requirement. A value of `0.0` (default) means pixels must be at the same or higher elevation. A negative value (e.g., `-2.0`) allows the search to traverse small depressions of that depth, preventing the watershed from being artificially truncated by minor pits in the DTM. | `-downhill_tolerance_m_per_pixel -1.5` |
| `-v` | Enable verbose output during processing. | |

## Output File
The tool generates an 8-bit JHC-format grid file (`.wsh`) which serves as a mask for the calculated watershed. Pixels within the watershed are assigned non-zero values, while pixels outside the watershed are zero.
