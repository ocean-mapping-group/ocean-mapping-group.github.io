# embedCont

## Description
`embedCont` is a utility for "burning" or embedding vector data, such as contour lines or ship tracks, directly into a JHC-format 8-bit grid file (i.e., an image or mosaic). It reads line segments from a vector file and draws them onto the raster image, modifying the image file in place. This is often used as a final step in map production to overlay line work on a base image.

## Usage
```bash
embedCont [OPTIONS] <8bit_mapsheet_file> <vector_file>
```

## Arguments

| Option | Description | Default / Example |
|---|---|---|
| `<8bit_mapsheet_file>` | **Required.** The 8-bit JHC grid file (e.g., `.mos`, `.8bit`) that will serve as the background image. **This file is modified in place.** | `background_mosaic.mos` |
| `<vector_file>` | **Required.** The file containing the vector data to be drawn. The format is specified by other options (see below). | `contours.bin` |
| `-col <value>` | Specifies the 8-bit color value (0-255) to be used for drawing the lines. | `-col 255` (white) |
| `-linethick <pixels>` | Sets the thickness of the drawn lines in pixels. | `-linethick 2` |
| `-ascii` | Specifies that the input `<vector_file>` is an ASCII text file. The tool expects each line to contain `latitude longitude value`. It connects consecutive points to form lines. | |
| `-pixel_coords` | Used with `-ascii`. Interprets the ASCII input as `x y value` in pixel coordinates instead of geographic `lat lon value`. | |
| `-isheader` | Specifies that the input `<vector_file>` is another JHC grid file. `embedCont` will read its header and draw its rectangular geographic bounding box onto the mapsheet. This is useful for creating index plots. | |
| `-buf <pixels>` | Used with `-isheader`. Allows the bounding box to be drawn even if it lies partially outside the main mapsheet's boundaries, by the specified pixel buffer amount. | `-buf 100` |
| `-maxlen_m <meters>` | A filter that prevents the tool from drawing any single vector segment that is longer than the specified length in meters. This is useful for cleaning up artifacts or gaps in contour or trackline data. | `-maxlen_m 1000` |
| `-v` | Enable verbose output. | |

## Input Vector Formats
`embedCont` supports three types of input for the `<vector_file>`:
1.  **Binary Vector (default):** A custom OMG-HDCS binary format (`.bin`) containing a series of line segments with associated values. This is the format generated by tools like `contgrid`.
2.  **ASCII Coordinates (`-ascii`):** A simple text file with geographic points that are connected sequentially.
3.  **JHC Header (`-isheader`):** Any JHC grid file, from which only the header's geographic extent is used to draw a box.
