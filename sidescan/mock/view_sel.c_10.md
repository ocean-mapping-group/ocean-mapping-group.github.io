# view_sel_10

## Description
`view_sel_10` is a variant of the `view_sel` utility, designed for interactive viewing and analysis of backscatter strength and grazing angle mosaics through an X-windows graphical user interface. Its core functionality is largely identical to `view_sel.c`, allowing users to select areas of interest, view sub-images, and compute angular dependence of backscatter within selected regions. This version might represent an older iteration or a slightly modified build for specific purposes.

## Usage
The usage and arguments for `view_sel_10` are essentially the same as `view_sel`. Please refer to the documentation for [`view_sel`](view_sel.md) for detailed information on command-line options.

## Interactive Mode
The interactive X-windows mode and user interactions are analogous to those described for [`view_sel`](view_sel.md).

## How It Works
The underlying logic and processing steps, including data loading, region selection, data accumulation, statistical calculation, and graphical output, are the same as described in the documentation for [`view_sel`](view_sel.md). Minor internal differences or optimizations may exist but do not change the high-level functionality.
