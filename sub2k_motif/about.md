# about

## Description
`about.c` is a Motif GUI source file, typically generated by an interface builder tool like X-Designer. Its purpose is to create and manage an "About" dialog box for the "Submetrix 2000 unraveller" application. This dialog displays essential information about the software, including its version (`v0.1`), author (J.E. Hughes Clarke), and affiliation (Ocean Mapping Group, University of New Brunswick, Canada).

## How It Works
This file uses Motif (Xm) and Xt Intrinsics libraries to define and instantiate GUI widgets.
1.  **`create_AboutShell(Widget parent)` function:**
    *   Creates a `DialogShell` widget (`AboutShell`) as the top-level window for the dialog.
    *   Creates a `MessageBox` widget (`AboutBB`) as the main content area of the dialog.
    *   Sets the dialog title to "About".
    *   Creates an `XmLabel` widget to display the descriptive text about the application.
    *   Creates an `XmPushButton` widget (`AboutOKButton`) for the "OK" button.
    *   Attaches a callback function (`OKCallback`) to the "OK" button, which presumably dismisses the dialog when clicked.
    *   Manages the children widgets to lay them out within the dialog.
This file is primarily a structural definition of a GUI element and does not contain core data processing logic.
