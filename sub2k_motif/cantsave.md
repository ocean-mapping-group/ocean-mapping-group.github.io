# cantsave

## Description
`cantsave.c` is a Motif GUI source file, typically generated by an interface builder tool like X-Designer. Its purpose is to create and manage a "Can't Save!" dialog box within the "Submetrix 2000 unraveller" application. This dialog is displayed to the user when a save operation fails or cannot be performed, providing feedback on the issue.

## How It Works
This file uses Motif (Xm) and Xt Intrinsics libraries to define and instantiate GUI widgets.
1.  **`create_CantSaveShell(Widget parent)` function:**
    *   Creates a `DialogShell` widget (`CantSaveShell`) as the top-level window for the dialog.
    *   Creates a `MessageBox` widget (`CantSaveBB`) as the main content area of the dialog.
    *   Sets the dialog title to "Can't Save!".
    *   Configures the dialog to be `XmDIALOG_FULL_APPLICATION_MODAL`, meaning it blocks interaction with other application windows until dismissed.
    *   Creates an `XmLabel` widget to display the descriptive text of the message (e.g., "Irrelevant junk comment\nmore of the same!").
    *   Creates an `XmPushButton` widget (`CantSaveOKButton`) for the "OK" button.
    *   Attaches a callback function (`OKCallback`, likely defined in `callbacks.c`) to the "OK" button, which presumably dismisses the dialog when clicked.
    *   Manages the children widgets to lay them out within the dialog.
This file is primarily a structural definition of a GUI element and does not contain core data processing logic.
