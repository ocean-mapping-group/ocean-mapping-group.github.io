# error

## Description
`error.c` is a Motif GUI source file, typically generated by an interface builder tool like X-Designer. Its purpose is to create and manage an "Error" dialog box within the "Submetrix 2000 unraveller" application. This dialog is displayed to the user when a system error occurs, presenting the relevant error message (obtained using `strerror(errno)`).

## How It Works
This file uses Motif (Xm) and Xt Intrinsics libraries to define and instantiate GUI widgets.
1.  **`create_ErrorShell(Widget parent)` function:**
    *   Retrieves the system error string using `strerror(errno)`.
    *   Creates a `DialogShell` widget (`ErrorShell`) as the top-level window for the error dialog.
    *   Creates a `MessageBox` widget (`ErrorBB`) as the main content area of the dialog.
    *   Sets the dialog title to "Error".
    *   Creates an `XmLabel` widget (`ErrorLabel`) to display the system error message (`error_string`).
    *   Creates an `XmPushButton` widget (`ErrorOKButton`) for the "OK" button.
    *   Attaches a callback function (`OKCallback`, likely defined in `callbacks.c`) to the "OK" button, which presumably dismisses the dialog when clicked.
    *   Manages the children widgets to lay them out within the dialog.
This file is primarily a structural definition of a GUI element and does not contain core data processing logic.
