# edReject

## Description
`edReject` is a specialized utility for automatically flagging spurious soundings within OMG-HDCS merged files using "Ed's method". This method focuses on detecting various types of "spikes" or sudden discontinuities in the depth profile across the swath, such as simple spikes, or flat-topped/bottomed spikes.

The tool calculates depth gradients (`delta`) between adjacent beams and flags beams where these gradients exceed a user-defined threshold (`eps`) or show specific patterns indicative of spikes.

## Usage
```bash
edReject <mergefile(s)> [-v] [-eps <value>]
```

## Arguments

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `<mergefile(s)>` | **Required.** One or more paths to OMG-HDCS merged files to be processed. These files are modified in place. |
| `-v` | Enable verbose output (present in the `main` function arguments but not explicitly used in the provided code snippet). |
| `-eps <value>` | (Present in `USAGE` but commented out in `main`'s argument parsing) Intended to specify the epsilon threshold for depth gradients. Default `0.1` is hardcoded in the `Eds_method` function. | `0.1` |

## How It Works
1.  **File Processing:** The tool iterates through each provided merged file.
2.  **Summary Header Reading:** Reads the summary header for basic file information.
3.  **Profile and Beam Iteration:** For each profile (ping) in the file:
    *   Reads the current `profile` header and raw `beams`.
    *   **Data Preparation:** Populates an `abeam` array (`allbeams`) with the `acrossTrack` and `observedDepth` values (converted to meters) for each beam.
    *   **Ed's Method Application:** Calls the `Eds_method` function to perform the core spike detection logic:
        *   **Gradient Calculation:** For each beam `i` (from 1 to `nodepths - 1`), it calculates `allbeams[i].delta` as the depth difference between `allbeams[i]` and `allbeams[i-1]`, divided by the absolute across-track difference.
        *   **Spike Detection Rules:** It then iterates through the beams and applies various rules based on `allbeams[i].delta` and its neighbors to identify spikes:
            *   **Spikes close to zero:** Flags beams adjacent to zero-depth readings if their `delta` exceeds `eps`.
            *   **Simple spikes:** Flags `beam_flags[i]` (using bitwise OR) if `allbeams[i].delta` is positive and `allbeams[i+1].delta` is negative (spike up then down), or vice-versa.
            *   **Spikes with high flat:** Flags `beam_flags[i]` if `allbeams[i].delta` is a strong positive/negative gradient, followed by a flat section, and then a strong negative/positive gradient.
        *   **Target Detection (Commented Out):** There's a section for "Target detection" that attempts to set `*profile_flag = 'T'` if any `beam_flags[i]` is non-zero and has adjacent non-zero flags. This part is currently not fully implemented or utilized to update the `profile.edflag`.
    *   **Flagging & Storing:** The flags generated by `Eds_method` (stored in `flags` array) are assigned to `beams[i].calibratedBackscatter`. The `profile.edflag` is also updated.
    *   **Write Back:** The modified `profile` header and `beams` are written back to the merged file.

## Output Files
*   The input merged files are modified in-place.
*   The `profile.edflag` field in the merged file's profile header is set to 'T' if targets are detected, otherwise it is '0'.
*   The `beams[i].calibratedBackscatter` field is used to store individual beam flags (0 for good, non-zero for flagged).

## Dependencies
*   `OMG_HDCS_jversion.h`: For OMG-HDCS data structures.
*   `support.h`: For general utility functions and error handling.

## Notes
"Ed's method" is a heuristic approach to spike detection that relies on local depth gradients and specific patterns. While the `eps` threshold is hardcoded in the function, it's designed to be effective for specific types of data artifacts. Repurposing `calibratedBackscatter` for storing flags suggests this tool is used for diagnostic or intermediate flagging purposes, and these flags might be reset or further processed by other tools. The `-eps` option is listed in the usage but not actively parsed, meaning the default value is always used.
